## Develop in a notebook

### Use Kaggle Jupyter notebooks

You can [create a notebook hosted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020/notebooks) to run your algorithms. This is the recommended way if you are not used to deploy Jupyter notebooks on your machine.

The [official WiDS datathon notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/wids-2020-starter-catboost-0-902-lb ) template can be used to start quickly
